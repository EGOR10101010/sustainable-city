<ul>
    <li><b>Health clinics</b> – General medical services, check-ups, overall diagnosis, rehabilitation, with good equipment such as:
        <ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Ambulances</b> – Accessible ambulances for critical situations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Health Education & Local Employment</h3>
<p>Providing opportunities for locals to get educated and trained to become doctors, psychiatrists, and other medical professionals.</p>

<h3>Incorporating Green Areas</h3>
<p>To improve both mental and physical health, we could incorporate green areas such as parks into our city plan.</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Improvement of health</b> – Fewer sick people, fewer chronic diseases, better treatment of illnesses, lower mortality rate (due to vaccinations and a healthier lifestyle).</li>
    <li><b>Access to medical care</b> – Including mental health support, maternity care, and more.</li>
    <li><b>Economic growth and development</b> – More businesses, improved education, increased awareness, and long-term sustainability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Health Statistics</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Injuries (road traffic injuries, drowning, burns, and falls) rank among the top 3 causes of death and lifelong disability among children aged 5-15 years. In 2012, violence and unintentional injuries killed an estimated 740,000 children under the age of 15, with the latter accounting for 90% of these deaths.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the worldwide number of overweight children increased from an estimated 31 million in 2000 to 42 million in 2015, including in countries with a high prevalence of childhood undernutrition.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Police Departments</h2>
<p>Police departments are not an optional addition as they are necessary. 
When large amounts of people are in a so-called city for long enough, disagreements and situations are bound to occur. 
Police departments can be economically friendly by using electric vehicles. 
They can use renewable energy and many other methods to become more sustainable.</p>

            <h2>Firefighter Departments</h2>
			<p>Fire stations offer security and safety to residents of a city by quickly responding to emergencies that are out of their control. 
			By implementing water saving technologies and other technologies that help do their job more sustainably it's possible to be more friendly towards the environment while continuing to fulfil the same job. </p>
