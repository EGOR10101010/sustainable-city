            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Our project designs a sustainable urban environment by integrating logistics, water resources, workplaces, housing, sustainable energy, medical districts, and entertainment.</p>
        <p>This site has been created as part of our Collaborative Science Project for an IB school, in order to help to improve a city. 
		The city was created in a modern and efficient way to improve social life. 
		We decided to focus on; affordable and clean energy production, industry innovation, sustainability and local communities, 
		providing a responsible consumption and production. </p>

<p>The best way of improving the clean energy production was to provide the city with solar panels, as well as wind turbines, 
which enabled the production of affordable and sustainable energy. By having offshore wind turbines, the energy production in even more efficient. </p>

<p>The whole city has been designed to improve industrial innovations, and  sustainability. 
The city is expected to be modern, and consist of and sustainable development. 
The city provides every local communities with good medical care, educational opportunities and entertainment services. 
The city also makes sure that the locals are safe and secured. </p>

<p>We provided the city with  many local businesses for example shops, restaurants, 
cafes and eco-friendly żabka that would be helpful in responsible consumption and production and that would improve the economy of the whole city. 
Providing good levels of consumption and production. </p>
