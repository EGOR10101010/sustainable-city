<h2>General Benefits of Workplaces to a City</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Economic growth (contributing to the city’s tax base)</li>
    <li>Job creation (workplaces provide employment opportunities, reducing unemployment and improving residents’ quality of life)</li>
    <li>Urban development (office buildings encourage infrastructure development by improving public transport)</li>
    <li>Innovation and entrepreneurship (workplaces in technology and finance industries foster innovation)</li>
    <li>Community and social benefits (workplaces encourage networking, collaboration, and cultural diversity)</li>
    <li>Environmental sustainability (modern workplaces with eco-friendly initiatives promote sustainability and reduce the city’s carbon footprint)</li>
</ul>

<h2>A System for Offices to Reduce the City’s Carbon Footprint</h2>
<p>Employees are rewarded for engaging in environmentally responsible behavior at home, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Proper waste sorting</li>
    <li>Utilizing LED lights</li>
    <li>Installing rain barrels</li>
</ul>

<h2>Statistics on the Impact of Workplaces on the Environment</h2>
<p>A recent report, <i>The State of Employee Engagement in Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility</i>, disclosed an encouraging statistic: <b>89%</b> of individuals would regularly utilize a sustainability practice introduced to them in the workplace at home.</p>

<p>Cool Choice, a nonprofit in Wisconsin, found that workplace competition can nudge at-home sustainability – advancing the realization of a sustainable city.</p>
<p>In our city we have a large amount of office places, which allows our city to have many available workplaces. 
There is one larger section on the top middle of the city and a smaller one near the bottom left. 
Workplaces in sanitary and safe buildings are very important so that people can productively and safely conduct their jobs. 
Jobs are present all over our city in other institutes such as the government building, hospital etc. </p>

 

 

 

 

 

<h3>Public transport</h3> 
<p>The public transport in our city consists of trams and busses. 
All of which using ecofriendly fuel such as hydrogen or electric motors. 
The tram lines and buses are used to help connect the city from office buildings to shops and back to homes. 
The usage of good quality and safe fuels allows the air quality to maintain a certain norm, as opposed to the bad air quality present in the main area of Jakarta.  </p>
